### Some stuff I'm into ðŸ‘‹

* reverse engineering of machine code/executable files, especially legacy code / old games from the 80s and 90s era. Love ghidra.	
* Low level embedded programming, bare metal stuff without any RTOS.	
    * Building embedded systems that combines electronics (sensors, actuators, radios ect) and code to do useful and/or fun tasks in the real world is always a blast.
    * In particular: drone programming.
* 3D programming, especially shader programming. You can find a very early stage 3D engine here.	
* Data science, especially stuff using graph theory like Complex Network Analysis.	
* Programming of systems containing lots of parallelism. This along with some data science stuff is my day job.	
* Any time I can help build systems that are reliable and that have utility for other people I'm a happy humanoid.
